# Todo

## Build command lines

* `cargo watch -x run -w src/`
* `cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

## Packaging the server

* [Getting started with Docker images](https://depot.dev/blog/docker-build-image)
* [Create Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/)
* [Restarting a Linux process](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/restart-running-process-failure)

## Page design

There are some interesting design elements on the [Tantivy tutorial](https://tantivy-search.github.io/examples/basic_search.html)

* Note the popup menu
* 2 tone background
* Vertical alignment of elements across the two columns

I also admire [this look](https://ryhl.io/blog/actors-with-tokio/). Nice and simple two panel design
