# Chimera

A Markdown documentation server. Modeled after my guess about how [MKDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs)
works, even though I've never used that tool.

## Goals

1. Transparently serve Markdown files
2. Cooperate with an existing fast, efficient web server (a la [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/))
3. Serve multiple origin folders
4. Nice-looking theme
5. Simple site navigation
6. Full text search
