## Page one

### Panel one

We see Spider-man swinging through a city street, up amongst the window washers and pigeons.
He has a young boy clinging to his shoulders, with a web-based sling wrapped around his waist
supporting this otherwise precarious perch.

**Boy**

    Holy crap!

**Spider-Man**

    Hang on, kid! Midtown gets a little windy this time of day.

**Spider-Man**

    Hey, do you want a hot dog? I see my guy down by Central Park. He always hooks me up! I figure he'll probably spring for you, too.

### Panel two

Close-up of a hot dog going into Spidey's mouth. His mask is pulled aside to give access to
his slavering gob.

**Spider-Man**

    Oh. Oh yeah. That's exactly right.
